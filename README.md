# AccessDatabase
An Access Database I made in University. 

Notes: Currently being made with SQL and Java (JDBC)

Its purpose was to input information(order,clients,suppliers) of a BookStore.

This was later changed for a Currier/Supply chain company, the files of which I no longer possess.

It will likely be updated at some point to a more useful version.
